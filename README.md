# RFID_Bracelet
This project is based on the previously create RFID project at university. This iteration is to be retried using a different language and tools. 

Problem Definition : The main issue is when at events how can we ensure those employed by the festival or emergency crews at attendance are able to act in swift and informed manner. For example this could be helping a child back to their parents, when lost at an event, being able to access medical information regarding an fesitival attenddee who may be unable to communicate effectively etc.
